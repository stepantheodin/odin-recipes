    <h1>Air Fryer Rib-Eye Steak</h1>
    <p>It's so easy to air-fry steaks in your air fryer. These definitely rival a steak cooked on the grill.</p>
    <p>You can marinate the rib-eyes in the morning before you leave for work, then cook them at night.</p>

        <li>Remove steaks from the bag and discard marinade. Pat excess oil off steaks.</li>

        <li>Cook steaks in the preheated air fryer for 7 minutes, flip, and cook about 7 minutes more for medium-rare. For a medium, cook 8 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Let steaks sit for about 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
